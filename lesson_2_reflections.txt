What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a .git metadata file to store all the commit and modifications info.
You need to write 'git init' in the directory you want to create the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It lets you pre-load the files that will further be added to the repository though a commit. The value of it is that it lets you see check witch files you're adding or might be missing in your commit.
